# Ten Things

There is much writing on the internet about how writing down ten ideas every day can  help you be more creative and excersize your 'idea muscle'. This is a simple bit of code to serve as a notepad for those ideas and store them over time. It has an extremely minimal interface to keep you focused on generating ideas. 

## Demo

View the project [on github pages](http://chris-pauley.github.io/ten-things). It saves to localstorage, so the lists are only accessible on the browser they were written in. However, it is responsive, so feel free to use your mobile device.
